  Rhyme:
  - 'Jumping Jack is quick and bold

    With skill his story will unfold'
  - 'THE BALAD OF JUMPING JACK

    A daring explorer named Jack...'
  - Once found a peculiar track...
  - There were dangers galore...
  - Even holes in the floor...
  - 'So he kept falling flat on

    his back...'
  - 'Quite soon he got used to

    the place...'
  - 'He could jump to escape from

    the chase...'
  - But without careful thought...
  - His leaps came to nought...
  - 'And he left with much

    wider face...'
  - 'Things seemed just as bad as

    could be...'
  - 'Hostile faces were all Jack

    could see...'
  - He tried to stay calm...
  - And to come no harm...
  - 'But more often got squashed

    like a flea...'
  - 'By now Jack was in a

    great flap...'
  - He felt like a rat in a trap...
  - If only he'd guessed...
  - That soon he could rest...
  - 'After jumping the very

    last gap.        - WELL DONE'
